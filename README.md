# Genio

## What is Genio?
Genio is a tutoring application made for all students from K-12. Many students struggle in school because they are disorganized and they lack study skills; however, tutors can help with that. Tutoring is very important because it gives each student individualized attention that they do not receive in a huge classroom. Tutoring can help students develop good study habits and skills for learning, which can strengthen their subject comprehension. Thatâ€™s where Genio comes in, it is a great tutoring application where students can look for tutors by subject or class.
